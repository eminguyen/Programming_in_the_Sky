# Programming-in-the-Sky-code
[04/22] Updated with solution code.
[04/20] Starter code for the Programming in the Sky Workshop 2018 (both sessions).

In order to begin, please follow the Pre-Workshop Instructable here: https://goo.gl/LHVD5R.

# Session 1 - Introduction to Python
This session will walk through basic Python syntax and constructs, such as printing, variables, logic, loops, and lists, and in the end build a Tic-Tac-Toe game (human-to-human). 

# Session 2 - Applications of Python: Machine Learning
This session will walk through using sklearn to load, plot, and classify datasets using k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Support Vector Machine, and Multiclass Perceptron. While installing Jupyter notebook is very highly recommended, running the code from a Python module will work fine.
